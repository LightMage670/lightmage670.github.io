The portfolio website is the first project and one of the easiest to see, given that you're using it right now. I started working on it in early September 2025, and it will always be a work in progress so long as I am in Computer Science, either as a career or a hobby.

Primary challenges:
Relearning HTML/CSS
Establishing a format document in HTML for the project
> Primarily challenging because it requires a vision of the final product
>
> Having everything in only a few documents has created some challenges when adding new items
>> Mixing navigation links with cards
>>> They both use the \<li> tag
>>>
>>> I had to use a mixture of classes and ids to ensure that the cards can be modified independently of the nav bar.
