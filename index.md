# Welcome

This is my portfolio website. It is the first project in the portfolio, and it is a place to document all other projects.

The About page contains information about me and how to get in contact with me. If you're looking to give me a job, head there.

The Projects page contains all of the projects I've worked on and remembered to put on my portfolio, which is this site. A not insignificant number of early projects from school have been lost and as such are not present. If you want to know about what work I've done, head there.
