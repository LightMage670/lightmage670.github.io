# About Me

I'm a computer science student in my senior year of my undergraduate degree. I've spent somewhere around the last 12 years working on computers in some form, from helping my mom set up computer labs for her school to starting coding to where I am now, finishing my degree and loving to learn about just about all things relating to software.

As much as I feel like this is a good idea for employment and whatever else, I also thoroughly enjoy making this website, practically from scratch. While Jekyll is in use for much of the backend, allowing site navigation and many of the shortcuts I'm using to make this, I made my own layout for the site using html. Feel free to have a look through on the github, which you can find over at the top of the projects page.

I will admit I currently hold a fairly negative view of AI, I prefer not using it in my schoolwork or projects. I much prefer, instead, to use the ancient methods of searching Google, Reddit, and StackOverflow on those projects, since I find it easier to learn that way. This isn't to say I can't or won't use AI, but rather that I do not find it useful for my current needs.
